My name is Ian, and I am a senior at Cornell University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. Last summer, I interned at [Molex Inc.](https://www.molex.com/molex/home) where I worked in digital circuit design and embedded programming. Currently, I am looking for a full-time position to start my career in software engineering. See more on my [resume](/iankranz_resume.pdf).

My main interests are in software development with a focus on data processing and real-time systems. I also have interest in software architecture and building large systems.

 In my free time I write for and layout [Cornell's campus humor magazine](http://cornelllunatic.com/). I also enjoy working with digital media, primarily audio and video. Check out my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQTXjOytaT-RSKwUIEx6v4Q)!
